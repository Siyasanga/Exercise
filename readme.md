Rope in inches

One of your friends got a rope shop in Houtbay harbour and asked you to help him calculate how much rope he is selling in centimeters. Write a function called lengthOfRopeSold that takes a string of rope lengths like this '1m, 20cm,3m,75cm, 35mm, 50cm' and calculate what lengths of rope he sold in centimeters.

He is also interested to know how much rope he sold in inches. One inch is equal to 2.5cm. How would you need to change the lengthOfRopeSold to return the total in inches.
How far?

A friend of yours is practicing for an upcoming half marathon and is keeping track of how far he is running. Write a function called howFarThisWeek that can calculate how many meters he ran for a given week. The function takes the weekly runs in a string like this '750m, 5km, 7km, 950m, 10km'.

He is also interested to know how many half marathon distances (21km) he is running per week.
